# neonatal-adr-signal-detection
This repository is part of my portfolio work that demonstrates my data analysis skills in the healthcare and pharmaceutical domains, especially in the area of pharmacovigilance and drug safety. The project focuses on analysing adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in neonatal patients. Working with a real-world dataset of more than 32,000 rows and seven key features, I show how to clean, transform, explore, and model health data to produce actionable insights.

In this project I clean, transform and explore a neonatal adverse drug reaction dataset to prepare it for analysis. Data cleaning tasks include handling missing values, converting age and weight data to standard formats, and encoding categorical variables. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed using Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) and SQL to identify patterns, trends, and outliers.

One of the main objectives is to identify common and disproportionate drug–reaction signals using standard pharmacovigilance methods such as Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) and Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR). These methods help to detect which drugs are most frequently associated with adverse reactions in newborns.

The project also includes building baseline machine learning models to classify the severity of ADRs (for example, Mild, Moderate, Severe) using Python’s scikit-learn library. SQL queries are used for initial data extraction and summarisation, while Python handles data manipulation and model building.

To make the results easier to understand, I create summary dashboards and visualisations using Power BI or Looker Studio. These dashboards present key findings such as top suspect drugs, most frequent reactions, patient demographics, and severity distributions.

This project showcases my ability to work with healthcare data, clean and analyse large datasets, apply statistical and machine learning techniques, and present the findings in an accessible way. It highlights my SQL, Python and visualisation skills and is designed as preparation for a data analyst role in a pharmaceutical company.

By combining data cleaning, analysis, modelling and visualisation, this project demonstrates practical data analysis and presentation skills relevant to drug safety, pharmacovigilance and healthcare analytics.
